# Data Scientist

### Overview
I am an aspiring data scientist looking to utilize my new skills in an impactful way. I have experience with Python, R, SQL, Tableau, PostgreSQL, RStudio, and Jupyter Notebooks.

### Projects

**N-Gram Language Models**

Developed two N-gram language models, a bigram and a fivegram, to predict missing words in a text. The sample text utilized to train and evaluate these models was the works of William Shakespeare. The main tasks implemented are data preparation, model training, text correction, and evaluation. This project was completed in a Python Jupyter Notebook.

**3D Sinusoidal Data using Artificial Neural Networks**

Utilized artificial neural networks to solve regression issues by fitting a neural network to a noisy 3D sinusoidal data set using a Sequential model. The main techniques implemented are standardization, fitting a sequential model with Keras, and plotting points with their prediction curve. This project was completed in a Python Jupyter Notebook.

**Database Management**

Interpreted and cleaned data through updates, drops, and alters. This project was completed in PostgreSQL in pgAdmin 4.
